<h1>Yoko Taro</h1>    
<p>The famous game developer best known for directorial work on video game series such as Drakengard and Nier </p>

<div id='history' class= "history">
    <h2>Brief History</h2>
    <p>Yoko Taro was born in Nagoya, Aichi, on June 6, 1970. Taro's parents were often absent at their jobs, so he was mostly raised by his grandmother, who left a strong impression on him. During his youth, he heard about an incident that would influence his later work as a scenario writer: while an acquaintance was in a shopping street with a group of friends, one of them who was walking along a high building roof slipped and died from the fall. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The scene as Yoko heard it was initially "horrifying", but included a humorous element as well. 
        <br/>
        He studied at Kobe Design University and graduated in March 1994. He is married to Yukiko Yoko, an illustrator who worked on Taiko no Tatsujin series and also did work on Drakengard 3.</p>

    <h3>Career</h3>
    <p>Known for his role as the creative director for Drakengard and NIER. He is the behind the grim, apathetic tone set within both titles. Most of the characterizations within these games are done under his supervision and approval. Although he is repeatedly told that fans adore his decisions in Drakengard, Yoko has no idea what he wanted to accomplish with the title or why it even has a following. He claims he wants to make works he thinks people will find entertaining, not grotesque or dark.
        <br/>
        <br/>
    Early in his career, he allowed photos of his face during interviews. In recent years, he either turns away from camera or hides his face behind a mask. During the Nier interviews, Yoko often wore a mask of No. 7's face. He most commonly uses a mask of his personal black and gray character, which can also be viewed upside down, or a hand puppet named "Yoko Uu", both designed by Yukiko Yokoo. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He professes to despise his visage being spread in the media and absolutely abhors interviews, as he finds them a "boring chore" in the development process. Terribly blunt about his opinions, Yoko believes fans can only learn his candid criticisms on his blog or Twitter rather than with the public media or company publications. Within his personal writings, he is quick to note his misgivings about the development process.
    Despite the grim nature of his works, Yoko is not a fan of horror or splatter films or real life gore. 
    <br/>
    He does admit to being strangely mesmerized by the artistic portrayals of fake blood. According to Akira Yasui's commentary, the generals mentioned in Kingsblood's weapon story is an inside reference to both him and Yoko.

    <h4>Other Works</h4>
    <p>He also authored a comic series called Kimi Shi ni Tamou koto Nakare or Thou Shalt Not Die, with illustrator Moriyama Daisuke (Chrono Crusade, World Embryo). 
        <br/>
        The title itself uses archaic Japanese and is a literary allusion to a poem of the same name written by Akiko Yosano about the Russo-Japanese War. The comic was later adapted for theater which was also penned by Yoko.</p>
