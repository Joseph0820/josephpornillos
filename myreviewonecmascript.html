            Now regarding my thoughts on EcmaScript is that I realize that it's basically an origin story of the now famous JavaScript. It's original purpose is that to serve as a language that can be used for websites
            and as the things grow and innovate throughout the years, you can see the progression from just a barebones language into a fullblown language that has its own several frameworks that can be used not only for websites, browser but also for server-side of things.
            Even in this day and age, JavaScript is still being used despite several new languages have been found and currently being used by the industry today such as Python but the fact that JavaScript, the language itself is still not obselete is a statement that as long people gets comfortable
            with that language and still receives support from its own community with updates from it's own frameworks, means that it'll stay for a very long time not just in the industry but for hobbyists and even students.
